- zlib API changed, KenLM cannot be compiled with zlib on Ubuntu 15.04,
  however, I did compile it w/out it
- I got to the point where UI cannot start because of missing LM data
- the LM data could be generated from sample texts, however, ngram-count
  utility from SRILM is necessary, thus next srep would be download and
  compilation of SRI LM
