- zlib API changed, KenLM cannot be compiled with zlib on Ubuntu 15.04,
  however, I did compile it w/out it
- I got to the point where UI cannot start because of missing LM data
- the LM data could be generated from sample texts, however, ngram-count
  utility from SRILM is necessary, thus next srep would be download and
  compilation of SRI LM

--- building on Arch Linux ---
- installed: boost, sip
- updated to latest KenLM, used the libraries that were needed
  - KENLM_MAX_ORDER has to be defined multiple times in makefiles/SIP .toml configs
- built binary artifacts, some paths are hardcoded wrt the project structure
- next up: update to current pyqt (pyqt4 not found)
- next up: SRILM ngram-count utility still applies
