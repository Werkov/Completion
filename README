Individual software project
===========================

Uses language models to predict what user is about to write.
It can be used:
 - in T9 or iTap like systems,
 - for auto-completion in text editors,
 - in devices for disabled people (writing with one finger, eye movements, etc.).

Dependecies
-----------
Needs Python3, PyQt4 for Python3, ICU library and SIP framework.
Partially it could be installed from these Ubuntu packages:
	- python3-sip 
	- python3-sip-dev

Alas, current Ubuntu repositories don't contain PyQt4 for Python3, therefore
they must be installed manually:
	- download from:
		- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
		- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
	- run (first SIP, then PyQt4):
		- python3 configure.py
		- make
		- sudo make install
