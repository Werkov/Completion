Completion project
===========================

Uses language models to predict what user is about to write.
It can be used:
 - in T9 or iTap like systems,
 - for auto-completion in text editors,
 - in devices for disabled people (writing with one finger, eye movements, etc.).

Dependecies
-----------
Needs Python3, PyQt4 for Python3, and SIP framework.
Partially it could be installed from these Ubuntu packages:
	- python3-sip 
	- python3-sip-dev
It's also recommended to have some NLP toolkit installed to
create ARPA files.

Alas, current Ubuntu repositories don't contain PyQt4 for Python3, therefore
they must be installed manually:
	- download from:
		- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
		- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
	- or download appropriate version as Git submodule
	- run (first SIP, then PyQt4):
		- python3 configure.py
		- make
		- sudo make install


Demo
----
(FIX: `chmod u+x Change src/sip/*/configure.py`, NTFS, Git and persmissions don't work well)
First run `make` in the root directory, it should:
	- compile KenLM objects,
	- compile KenLM wrapper and ARPA selector objects,
	- compile executables for building binary files from ARPA
	  for KenLM and ARPA selector,
	- generate SIP bindings sources and compile them to .so
	  Python modules,
	- create binary files for sample language model.

If everything works properly demo could be started by
`./src/python/ui-demo.py b -lm sample-data/povidky.bin -sel sample-data/povidky.sel.bin`.
